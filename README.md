## Find A Home

The Find a Home project is an effort by a Code for San Jose team to provide mobile and web applications that make finding affordable housing in the Bay Area not only easy but also moderately fun. To check the original repo, go to Code for San Jose - Find A Home (Github Repo)[https://github.com/codeforsanjose/findahome]

# Why

The California Bay Area is currently going through a housing epidemic; rapidly increasing demand for housing is outpacing supply, which is leading to a massive increase in housing costs. To help alleviate the burden of this effect, Bay Area counties restrict rent growth and have land owners set aside rent controlled housing for those who make less than a predetermined amount - with the amount correlating strongly with the median income for the rent controlled area.

Finding affordable housing in the Bay Area is difficult. Cities and counties provide various data on senior, special needs, and family affordable housing. The goal of Find A Home is to consolidate that information and provide a user-friendly web application to navigate and filter nearby affordable housing units.
